Task:1 (Porfolio)
This is a simple responsive portfolio website  that I made for task 1 of web development. 

I learned so much while making this 

I have used:
HTML5 for markup
Pure CSS3 for styling
Bit of Jquery to make header animation effects work
Bit of JavaScript to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices
Font Awesome for Icons
Unsplash for Images

Task2: (Blog Website)
This is a fully responsive personal blog website designed to share content and engage with users across various devices. The website is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a clean and modern design. It consists of four main pages: a Home Page, which showcases the latest blog posts and offers a brief introduction to the blog; an About Page, where users can learn more about the blog's purpose and the author's background; a Search Page, which allows visitors to easily find specific content within the blog; and a Contact Page, providing a way for users to reach out directly. The responsive design ensures that the website looks and functions well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices alike.
