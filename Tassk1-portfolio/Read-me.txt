This is a simple responsive portfolio website  that I made for task 1 of web development. 

I learned so much while making this 

I have used:
HTML5 for markup
Pure CSS3 for styling
Bit of Jquery to make header animation effects work
Bit of JavaScript to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices
Font Awesome for Icons
Unsplash for Images
